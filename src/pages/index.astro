    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
        My name is Michelle Herola Dagsa, and I am 22 years old. 
        I come from the picturesque municipality of Cagwait, 
        located in the beautiful province of Surigao del Sur. 
        Growing up in such a serene and vibrant place has 
        shaped my appreciation for nature and community. 
        I am currently a 4th-year student 
        pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, 
        a field that challenges and excites me as 
        I delve deeper into technology and its potential to solve real-world problems.

    <p>
        One of my greatest passions is cooking, 
        which has become a creative outlet for me. I love experimenting with new recipes and exploring different cuisines, as it allows me to combine my love for flavors and artistry. Beyond cooking, I have an innate curiosity for learning new things, whether it's picking up a new skill, exploring innovative technologies, or understanding different perspectives. I believe that continuous learning not only enhances my personal growth but also prepares me for a future full of opportunities and challenges. My journey is driven by my determination to excel and make meaningful contributions to the world around me.

        I enjoy cooking as a creative outlet and a way to share love through food. Traveling fuels my curiosity and allows me to explore new places and cultures.
